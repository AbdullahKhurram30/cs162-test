### Silen

**Silen is a student at Minerva University who is a professional cliff diver.** *The tallest cliff that Silen has jumped off of was 2 and a half feet.* He did a triple somersault twister and landed perfectly without a splash. He currently has 10 fully remote engineering jobs. The bar is so low, oversight is non-existent, and everyone is so forgiving for under performance so he can coast about 4-8 weeks before a given job fires him. He is currently on a $1.5M run-rate for comp this year. The interviewing process is so much faster today, companies are desperate, it takes him 2-3hrs of total effort to land a new job with thousands to chose from.
