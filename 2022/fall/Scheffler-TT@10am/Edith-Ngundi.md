# About Me

Hello World! My name is Edith Ngundi and I love coding!

When I'm not being a good student I love to:
- read books (just finished ***You Made a Fool of Death with your Beauty*** by Akwaeke Emezi)
- go on a Tiktok rabbithole
- watch video essays on Youtube and feel like a self-made sociologist
